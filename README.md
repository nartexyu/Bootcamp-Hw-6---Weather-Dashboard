# Weather-Dashboard
   
This weather dashboard has an input box where the user can input a city to retreive the current weather information as well as the next five day forecast. The current weather information will contain an icon representing the weather, temperature in Fahrenheight, humidity %, wind speed in MPH, and UV-index. The forecasted weather information will include the same information except the wind speed and UV-index. If the UV-index is less than 3, it will be displayed in a green box for favorable; if it is greater than 3 but less than 6 it will be displayed in a yellow box for moderate; if it is greater than 6, 
it will be displayed in a red box for severe. 

With each searched city, the city will be appended to a list below to as representation of the users search history. If the user wishes to review the city's weather, the user may click on the box in the search history to review the weather data again. If the user decides to close the dashboard but come back to it later, it will still contain the last searched city's weather data.
